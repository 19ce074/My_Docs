## Create a Resource group:

Sure! Here are the steps to create a resource group in Microsoft Azure in Markdown format:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) using your Azure account credentials.

2. Once you're signed in, click on the "Resource groups" option in the left-hand navigation menu.

3. In the "Resource groups" blade, click on the "+ Add" button to create a new resource group.

4. In the "Basics" tab of the "Create a resource group" page, fill in the following details:
   - **Subscription:** Select the Azure subscription you want to use.
   - **Resource group:** Enter a unique name for your resource group. The name can contain letters, numbers, periods, underscores, and hyphens.
   - **Region:** Select the Azure region where you want your resource group to be located.

5. Click on the "Next: Tags" button to proceed to the next tab, or you can skip this step if you don't want to add any tags.

6. In the "Tags" tab, you can add tags to your resource group if needed. Tags are name-value pairs that help you organize and categorize resources.

7. Click on the "Next: Review + Create" button to proceed to the next tab.

8. In the "Review + Create" tab, review the details you provided for the resource group. If everything looks correct, click on the "Create" button to create the resource group.

9. Azure will now validate the provided information and create the resource group. This process may take a few moments.

10. Once the resource group is created successfully, you will see a notification indicating that the deployment is complete. You can then click on the "Go to resource group" button to navigate to the newly created resource group.
