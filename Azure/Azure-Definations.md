## Cloud Computing
Service delivery model over the internet (cloud). This includes but is not limited to

+ **compute power** meaning servers such as windows, linux, hosting environments, etc.
+ **storage like** files and/or databases
+ **networking** in azure but also outside when connecting to your company network
+ **analytics** services for visualization and telemetry data

## Key concepts

+ **scalability** is the ability to scale, so allocate and deallocate resources at any time
+ **elasticity** is the ability to scale dynamically
+ **agility** is the ability to react fast (scale quickly)
+ **fault tolerance** is the ability to maintain system uptime while physical and service component failures happen
+ **disaster recovery** is the process and design principle which allows a system to recovers from natural or human induced disasters
+ **high availability** is the agreed level of operational uptime for the system. It is a simple calculation of system uptime versus whole lifetime of the system.
+ **availability** = uptime/(uptime + downtime)
